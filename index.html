        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, My name is Laisha Galicia, I attended at University of California, Riverside. I major in psychology. I got my bachelor degree and also I push myself to get my master degree.  I choose this major because its a dream of mine, with my degree I choose to become a therapist.  I want to be able to help others around the world who have any type of issues and need help and opening up to others. My professional experience has been going so amazing, I have come such a long way , I have succeeded in life and accomplish goals I had for myself even before I went to the professional world. I've had people who have thank me for helping me and I feel so proud of myself for being able to accomplish that. I come prepared to change behavior in a good way, focus on their relationship with other people and also with themselves.   <br><br>

        In my Hispanic household , I'm a first generation. Being the first has become so challenging especially because you need to learn on your own and figure the future on your own. Since I do come from strict hispanic household, I notice that they will think going to therapy for help was known to be crazy. I disagree in opinions like these, I believe therapy is a good way to help yourself, open up to others, and also understand yourself.. Some people suffer from different things and its good to have someone you can open up and talk to. It can feel like a safe place. Since I had my degree I had change my family opinion and they agree with therapy is good for anyone. <br><br>

        With my degree, I have so many goals I still wanna accomplish. I have been able to help so many people with any problems. I been able to make them feel safe and everything they want to open up to me will be kept between us two only. To me its so important to not only be their therapist but also be there friend. I want to be there through their path of therapy. I want to make sure everyone feels okay. My biggest goal is make postive changes. Anybody is welcome to come includimg people who had a taranatize experience and have an addiction. I want to be able to make good habits for them, focus on their wellness and personal growth. A accomplish that I have made so far is have people take good care of them seleves where they can feel mentally and pysically okay. I am here to talk what their life goals are and how they can accomplish it. Decision making is a important thing to do if you end up doing a bad decision not only can it affect you but also others around you. Its so important for me to help them just think about good decision making in life. Anything in this world is possible. I am here for that.
